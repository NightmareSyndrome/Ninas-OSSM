# OSSM

This is my first "ok"-working sketch for the OSSM from Kinkymakers.

It provides:
- A WebServer for the controlls
- Sliders for speed and distance
- BPM indicator
- Manual moves
- Homing Button
- Torque dis/enable!

I want to thank Emma for the implementation of the fastaccelstepper library
